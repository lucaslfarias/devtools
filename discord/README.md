# Discord
Install Discord on Fedora

1. Open a terminal window as your user.
1. Be in your home directory ("cd" with no arguments should take you there if you aren't already) and create a folder Discord: ***mkdir Discord***
1. Go to the discord website, select download for linux, and grab the .tar.gz file instead of the .deb file. Save it into the Discord directory you just created (/home/(your name)/Discord)
1. Uncompress the file from that terminal window:
1. cd ~/Discord
1. gunzip (name of .tar.gz file)
1. Untar that file: tar xvf (name of .tar file)
1. Run the executable "Discord" with ./Discord
1. You can also create an alias to open Discord quicker!
